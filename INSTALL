                  Compiling and Installing SML#

== Requirements

The following softwares are required to build and install SML#:

  * GNU C compiler (version 3.4.0 or higher)
  * GNU make or BSD make
  * Standard ML of New Jersey (version 110.0.7 or 110.6x)

The following modules are required to build, but they are in the
same package.

  * SMLFormat (bundled)
  * basis_compat (bundled)

To obtain native executable files of SML#, the following software
is additionally required.

  * MLton-20051202

The following tools are required to build documents, but they are
not required to build compiler and runtime.

  * SMLDoc (bundled)
  * doxygen

== Quick Start

  % ./configure
  % make
  % make install

Things will be installed under /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/smlsharp.

If you meet some troubles caused by C compiler, rerun configure
to try to compile with another compiler.

  % CXX=<ANOTHER_COMPILER> ./configure


== Customizing install location

Run configure with --prefix option to specify where to install.

  % ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX>

If the --prefix option is omitted, /usr/local is assumed as PREFIX.
Things are installed in those locations:

  <PREFIX>/bin/smlsharp          SML# compiler
  <PREFIX>/bin/smlsharprun       SML# runtime
  <PREFIX>/bin/smlsharp2exe.sh   Standalone executable maker
  <PREFIX>/lib/smlsharp/         Directory for libraries of SML#


== Compiling with MLton

Even using MLton, SML/NJ is required to build.  Run "make all" at
first, then run "make mlton" before install. Native executable files
compiled by MLton will be installed by "make install".

  % ./configure
  % make
  % make mlton
  % make install
