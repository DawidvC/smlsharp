              SML# - a new language in the ML family

           http://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/
	
SML# is a new generation of the Standard ML family of programming
languages being developed at Research Institute of Electrical
Communication, Tohoku University.  It desing goal is to provide a
moderate but practically important extensions based on recent advance
in type theory for ML-style languages while maintaining the
compatibility of the Definition of Standard ML.

The main features of SML# include the following.
* interoperability
  Our newly developed memory managenent method makes SML# program
  higly interoperable with C and Java. For example, SML# program can 
  dynamically load a C function and passes an array of floating point
  numbers without any data conversion.
* record polymorphism
  The type system of SML# fully supports record polymorphism.
  Moreover, its type directed compiler generates efficient code for
  polymorphic record operations.
* extension of Standard ML
  SML# is a conservative extension of the Definition of Standard ML.
  The programmer can enjoy the new features with a rich collection of
  existing library for Standrd ML.

This distibution contains the alpha-version of the SML# compiler for
evaluation of the language, and not intends to serve as a production
compiler. The alpha-version has the following limitations.
* It only provides bytecode interpreter.
* Interoperability is limited to C through dynamically linked
  library.
* Optimization is under development.
