Multithread Sieve of Eratosthenes

This program creates native threads as many as prime numbers to be
enumerated.

The following things are required to run this sample:

1. SML# must be compiled and installed with --enable-thread configure option.

2. This sample works only in native code with non-moving GC.

3. Operating system must provide POSIX thread (pthread) library.
   If your OS requires additional compile options to enable pthread support,
   specify the option by using --xCFLAGS and/or --xLDFLAGS option.
   For example:

   smlsharp --native --xLDFLAGS=-lpthread load.sml
