</head>
<body>
This is a library for easy scripting.
<p>
The objective of this library is to attract other scripting languages
users, who are not familiar with functional language but who have interest
in it.
</p>
<p>
This library shows that they can write ML codes of the same functionality
as those written in their familiar languages with no difficulties.
Interface of this library is in imperative style rather than functional
style, in order to make levels of entry lower for newcomers.
</p>
<p>
This library provides the following features.
<ul>
 <li>text manipulation
   <ul>
     <li>word, field, and line manipulation
     <li>string matching and substitution
     <li>regular expression matching and substitution
   </ul>
 <li>easy access to standard I/O
   <ul>
     <li>'print' and 'inputLine' on standard I/O are available at top level
       by default.
   </ul>
 <li>cooperation with shell
   <ul>
     <li>easy access to environment variable
     <li>easy access to command line argument
        command invocation
   </ul>
</ul>
Many of them are just thin wrappers of functions defined in Basis library.
</p>
<p>
The motto of this library is 'easy coding' rather than 'clean coding'.
The interface needs not be neat.
It should gather various features greedily.
</p>
<p>
This module aims to provide the same easiness as the functions which are
available at the top-level in other scripting languages.
